Model Initialization: Initialize an instance of the FBProphet model, which is a forecasting tool built on top of Facebook's Prophet library designed for time series forecasting.
Model Fitting: Fit the FBProphet model to the training data. The model will automatically detect seasonal patterns and trends in the data.
Forecasting: Use the fitted model to make predictions on the testing data and generate forecasts for future time periods.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the FBProphet model using appropriate metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
